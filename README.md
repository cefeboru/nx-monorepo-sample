✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

You can generate a similar project using the ts preset like so:
```
npx create-nx-workspace my-workspace --preset=ts
```

This will set up the @nrwl/js plugin for you, which allow us to generate packages easily with TypeScript already configured for us. You can read more here: https://nx.dev/packages/js

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Adding a library/package

```
nx g @nrwl/js:lib my-buildable-lib --buildable
```
